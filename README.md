# hrw-elte
Filter, export, and print single E-Learning tests.
This extension filters sections from moodle test pages (i.e. removes comments, history, or outcomes), prints tests, and exports test attachments as a single zip. The extension only works on web pages of the University of Applied Sciences Ruhr West, and helps to export a single person's test.
